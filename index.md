## Welcome to dice roller

Dice roller is an easy-to-use Google Sheets Add-on that integrates with Discord. It can send roles from your Google Sheets 5th edition D&D character sheet directly to your discord server.

## Installation

The Add-on is currently in testing. If you would like to join the testing program, click [here](mailto:waternlava@gmail.com?subject=Request%20to%20join%20dice%20roller%27s%20testing%20program&body=My%20email%20is:%0a%0aThanks%0a) to send me an email.

## Features

 - Roll a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 or d100
 - Roll for ability checks, saving throws, attack roles, etc.
 - Roll damage for a weapon or spell
 - Send the result to a discord webhook

## Limitations

Currently, the Add-on only functions with GSheet v2.1 created by [The Copper Sanctum](https://thecoppersanctum.github.io/thecoppersanctum/) available [here](https://gsheet2.avrae.io/).

## Roadmap

These are some features that don't exist yet, but that I intend to add soon:
 - Seperate icons for each weapon type in the player's handbook
 - Support for other spreadsheet character sheets
 - Support for more complicated weapons and dice formulas with multiple dice involved
 - Support for rolling hit die
 - Support for other bonus types like sneak attack, bless, smites, hunter's mark, etc.
 - Support for rolling with advantage/disadvantage
 
If there's anything you want added that is not on the list or if you want to influence what new features I prioritize, you can submit a [feature request](https://github.com/waterlava/dice-roller/issues/new/choose).
